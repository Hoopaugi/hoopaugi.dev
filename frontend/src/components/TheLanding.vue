  <h3>Hello, World!</h3>
  As things currently stand, this is just a stripped down version of the Vue.js template project. As
  you can clearly see, web design is my passion.
  <br /><br />
  Not really sure what to put here yet, probably something related to the projects I have done. I
  suppose the site is going to function as an extension of my CV. Maybe it will host a blog in the
  future? Not sure yet.
  <br /><br />
  For now, it's just going to function as a playground for me to learn the basics of Vue.js, and as
  a production ready project to get more familiar with AWS
